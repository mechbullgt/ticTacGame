Button onClick
1) Notice how with onClick={() => alert('click')}, we’re passing a function as the onClick prop. React will only call this function after a click. Forgetting () => and writing onClick={alert('click')} is a common mistake, and would fire the alert every time the component re-renders.

State
2) We want the Square component to “remember” that it got clicked, and fill it with an “X” mark. To “remember” things, components use state.

this.state
3) this.state is private to the React component it's defined in.

Why super(props) in all the constructors?
4) In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start it with a super(props) call.

5) Analogy
props = current account in a bank
state = savings account in a bank

6) Reacts Way for event and handlers.
In React, it’s conventional to use on[Event] names for props which represent events and handle[Event] for the methods which handle the events.
onClick() = Event attribute for the DOM Button
handleClic() = method that handles the event

7) Data change must be with mutation, i.e, immutability of the Data
var player={score:1, name:'Maqbool'};
var newPlayer = {...player, score:2}; //Object spread syntax, New player with score 2
var newPlayer2 = Object.assign({},player, score:3);
This helps in time travel to implement undo and redo functionalilties without modifyig the start state.

8) Make "Pure Components" in React by using immutability of the data by determining if the changes made require a re-rendering of the application.
"Pure Components" = shouldComponentUpdate()
Helps in "Optimizing the Performance"

9) Function Components = Components with only render() and no own state, so no need to extend from React.Component.

10) Array push() vs concat()
Concat method doesn't mutate the original array.

11) Always have key assigned to a list, to avoid jumbled list.
<li key={user.id}>{user.name}:{user.taskCount} tasks left</li>
Note: this.state.key is not possible as React uses this internally to update components.
A component can't insquire about ts key.
